## Synopsis

This JAVA project is compiler for VHDL. A compiler is a program that transforms source code written in a programming language, VHDL in this case, (the source language), into a target language which is a binary form known as object code. The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code).  
This project is using JLex and CUP.
VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) is a hardware description language used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as field-programmable gate arrays and integrated circuits. VHDL can also be used as a general purpose parallel programming language.

## Motivation

This project was an assesment for the module of Computer Architecture in the B.Eng. Telecommunications Engineering.
